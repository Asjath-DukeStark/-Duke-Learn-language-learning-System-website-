            <h3>Albert Camus L'Etranger</h3>
      
            <p>"L'Étranger' (The Stranger) is a seminal work in existentialist literature. The novel follows the story of Meursault, a detached and indifferent Algerian clerk who becomes embroiled in a senseless murder. Through Meursault's perspective, Camus explores themes of absurdity, alienation, and the meaninglessness of existence. Meursault's existential journey challenges conventional notions of morality and societal expectations, making 'L'Étranger' a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition."</p>
